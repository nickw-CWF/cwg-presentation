# Project Overview

## National Fish Passage Program

Increased freshwater focus on connectivity and fish passage:

- Watershed Connectivity Remediation Planning framework and barrier remediation in B.C.
- Chinook salmon research in Upper Yukon River
- American eel research and advocacy
- Fish passage advocacy and barrier campaigns
- **<span style="color: #de3c26;">Development of the Canadian Aquatic Barriers Database (CABD)</span>**

</center>

## What is the conservation issue?

What we know:

- Structures like dams, culverts, and dykes block the movement of fish and other species
- Barriers to fish passage are extensive across Canada
- Barriers removal needed to restore access to important habitat
- Restoration projects are expensive

## What is the conservation issue?

What we don't know:

- How many barriers exist in Canada?
- How much habitat is not accessible?
- How do we identify the most important barriers to maximize benefits?

**<span style="color: #de3c26;">We need comprehensive information to answer these questions</span>**

## Canadian Aquatic Barriers Database (CABD)

<center>
**<span style="color: #de3c26;">Vision:</span>**
</center>

<center>
All Canada's barrier and connectivity information in one place -- easily and openly accessible!
</center>

## Project Background

- CABD = central pillar of tools to support CWF's fish passage program
- Identify and prioritize barriers for restoration
- Inspired The Nature Conservancy's (TNC) work in the northeastern U.S.

<center>
![barrier-removal](./img/barrier-removal.jpg)
</center>

## A Roadmap for Improving Connectivity

- TNC's Northeast Aquatic Connectivity Assessment Project:
  + A database as a partnership building tool
  + Brings groups together and centralizes efforts
  + Led to significant improvements to fish passage and connectivity

## Penobscot River Restoration (Maine)

- Partnership between government, Indigenous groups, NGOs, and industry
- Two dam removals and one fishway
- 2018: **<span style="color: #de3c26;">2.8 million+</span>** river herring returned

<center>
![bypass](./img/bypass.jpg){height=450px}
</center>

## Importance of Collaboration and Engagement

- Potential uses of CABD extend beyond CWF's needs
  + Freshwater connectivity research
  + Hydrological modelling
  + Infrastructure inventories
- CABD can improve collaboration and partnership
- Launched external engagement to get input on design

<center>
![not-alone](./img/not-alone.png){height=250px}
</center>

## Stakeholder Engagement

- User interviews
  + What type of work could the CABD support?
  + What information would be useful?
  + How would users like to access the data?
- Working Group and Technical Advisory Committee

## Data Gathering and Sharing

- CABD relies on existing repositories
  + Local in scale
  + Single barrier types
  + No standardization
- CWF provides national coordination **<span style="color: #de3c26;">without</span>** duplicating effort
- Establish **<span style="color: #de3c26;">reciprocal</span>** relationships
  + Share data back to providers

&nbsp;

<center>
![network](./img/network.png){height=200px} ![two-way](./img/two-way.png){height=200px}
</center>

## What will the CABD be used for?

1. Habitat status assessments and reporting (watershed &rarr; national scales)
2. Informing management and regulatory decisions
3. Restoration planning and prioritization
4. Research and monitoring
5. Education and public outreach

## Public Launch (version 1)

- Public "sneak peek" release in  pilot regions: **<span style="color: #de3c26;">early November</span>**
- Initial release:
  + Dams, waterfalls, fishways
  + Stream and river networks
- Release remaining data through summer 2022
- Add additional barrier types in future years (e.g., stream crossings)

## Next Steps

- Continue information gathering
  + **<span style="color: #de3c26;">Phase 1:</span>** Compile existing datasets (including stream-crossings)
  + **<span style="color: #de3c26;">Phase 2:</span>** Begin to fill data gaps (with input from citizen scientists!)
- Expand features in the web tool

<center>
![assessment](./img/assessment.jpg)
</center>

## Additional Tools

**<span style="color: #de3c26;">Develop or adapt citizen science apps</span>**

- Partner and public participation to identify and assess barriers:
  1. Information entry portal - allow direct additions to CABD
  2. Mobile app - public can identify and assess barriers
- Collaboration opportunities with existing apps
  + <a href="https://portal.amber.international/" data-preview-link>AMBER (Europe)</a>
  + <a href="https://image.winudf.com/v2/image1/Y29tLndvb2RsYW5kc25vcnRoLmFid2NpX3NjcmVlbl8yXzE1ODkwNzYyODFfMDYy/screen-2.jpg?fakeurl=1&type=.jpg" data-preview-link>Alberta Watercourse Crossing Inventory app</a>

## Long-term Funding, Hosting, and Management

- Current funding from DFO and RBC Foundation through 2022-23
- Development and data compilation are most expensive phases
- Long-term maintenance and updating = major challenge for databases
  + But, lower annual costs
- Future funding options:
  + Perpetual fundraising?
  + CWF endowment?
  + Hand off to government?
